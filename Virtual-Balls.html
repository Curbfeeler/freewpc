<h3 class="section">7.5 Virtual Balls</h3>

<p>The device system generally assumes that there is one ball-sensing
switch for every ball that might be in the device.  Thus, a 4-ball
trough needs 4 switches.  The tracker recounts balls periodically
and does this just by polling each switch to see if a ball is present
or not.

   <p>For some devices, this is not possible.  Consider the Twilight Zone
gumball machine, which can hold 3 or 4 balls but there are no
switches inside to verify this.  To handle this case, <dfn>virtual balls</dfn>
are supported.  This is a per-device counter that is completely software
controlled.  APIs exist to add/remove virtual balls that cannot be seen
by switches.  Machine-specific code must be written to manage this.

   <p>When a device driver knows for sure that a ball has entered the device,
it calls <code>device_add_virtual</code>.  The extra ball will be tracked and
counted even though there is no switch to see it anymore.  When virtual
balls are added, the device <code>enter</code> event is thrown as usual, as
if a physical ball had entered.

   <p>When it knows that a ball has exited the device, it calls
<code>device_remove_virtual</code>.  This decrements the virtual ball counter. 
This behaves exactly like when a real ball is kicked out, so the
<code>kick_success</code> event is thrown and the live ball count goes up.
