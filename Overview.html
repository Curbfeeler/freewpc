<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p>FreeWPC is a toolkit for building brand new software for pinball machines. 
It primarily targets the Williams WPC
family of games, which was used in all of that company's games from 1990-1999,
starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Funhouse</span></samp>&rsquo; and ending with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cactus Canyon</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>This document provides an overview of the FreeWPC architecture for
developers who wish to understand how the system works. 
FreeWPC is constantly evolving and the information here is
subject to change.

   <p>FreeWPC only replaces your game ROM (the U6 chip on the CPU board), which contains all
of the game code and dot matrix text/graphics.  In particular, sounds and
music are NOT included in this device, so FreeWPC games use the
same sounds as the real machines.

   <p><a name="index-Legalese-1"></a>FreeWPC is 100% Williams-free code, written from scratch.  It is not a hack on existing
ROMs and does not contain any software extracted from real games. 
Most of the code is written mostly in the C programming language.  (Actual WPC games
were programmed in assembly language).  FreeWPC uses the freely available GCC6809 C
compiler.  There are some assembly language routines for really low-level, or high
performance parts of the program.

   <p><a name="index-WPC-generations-2"></a>All generations of WPC are supported.  FreeWPC is also architected into a number of
distinct layers which makes it highly portable to other
types of pinball machines than just WPC games, including new custom hardware.  The
<em>platform</em> files describe the circuit boards.  The <em>CPU</em> files are specific to
the microprocessor, and can be shared between platforms (WPC and WhiteStar both use
a 6809).  The <em>machine</em> files are unique to a particular game.

   <p><a name="index-Cygwin-3"></a>Development requires a UNIX-like environment, such as Linux or Cygwin for Microsoft Windows
users.  Many common UNIX tools like <samp><span class="command">bc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">perl</span></samp> are required.

   <p>FreeWPC has become more portable over the years, so that it can be used to develop
pinball software for platforms other than WPC.  This support is still evolving rapidly. 
In addition to building ROMs, the toolkit supports <dfn>native mode compilation</dfn>, which
builds an executable that can be run directly on your development machine.  This lets you
test and debug the software without requiring a real machine or even an emulator.  Basically,
native mode replaces the lowest level of hardware access with builtin emulation.  In place
of actual I/O being controlled, it displays the results of the simulation on your screen,
using either the console, <samp><span class="command">ncurses</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">gtk</span></samp>.
