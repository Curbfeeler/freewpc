<h2 class="chapter">8 Test Mode</h2>

<p>The FreeWPC test mode works similarly to the original WPC menu system. 
However, there are extra options and a few important differences. 
For testing core changes to FreeWPC, it is often more convenient to use
test mode than to play a game.

   <p>You can navigate the menus with the flipper buttons in addition to the
coin door buttons.  Use Start to enter, and double flip to exit.

   <p>When compiling with the <code>MACHINE_TEST_ONLY</code> option, the game
will boot directly into test mode, and there is no provision to start a game.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Adjustments</h3>

<p>All of the <em>standard adjustments</em> are supported.  There are also a few
new adjustments.

   <p><dfn>Timed Game</dfn> allows you to switch between normal game play and a timed
game.  Machines can implement different rules for timed play or not. 
They can also disable it entirely.

   <p><dfn>Payment Type</dfn> configures whether the display asks you to insert
coins, bills, or swipe a card.

<h3 class="section">8.2 Audits</h3>

<p>All of the <em>standard audits</em> are supported.

   <p>Presently, audits are kept as 16-bit integers, so they max out at 65535. 
This will probably change at some point.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Tests</h3>

<p>The test menu contains roughly the same tests as in the actual WPC
games, with some differences.

   <p>The solenoid test lets you control the duration and duty cycle of
each coil pulse by using the flipper buttons.

   <p>The development menu contains a series of additional tests that are
probably only relevant to developers and not to end users.  Current
tests include:

     <ul>
<li>Trigger specific display/lamp effects
<li>Browse lamplists
<li>Examine the states of all multiball devices
<li>Test the random number generator
<li>Test display transition effects
<li>Run a display effect stress test
<li>Analyze task scheduler performance
<li>Analyze interrupt handler performance
<li>Test the presentation of scores in multi-player games
<li>A memory editor that allows inspection/modification of any
memory address. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.1 Font Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through all of the available fonts.  Use the flipper buttons
to scroll through the alphabet.  The machine will try to display
as much as possible at once, depending on the font size.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Display Effect Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through all display effects.  Press ENTER to activate a deff,
as if <code>deff_start</code> were called.  For long-running effects, press
ENTER again to stop it via <code>deff_stop</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.3 Lamp Effect Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through all lamp effects.  Press ENTER to activate a leff,
as if <code>leff_start</code> were called.  Press ENTER again to stop it.

   <p>Remember that multiple lamp effects can be active simultaneously if
they are declared as shared and they do not overlap in the lamps that
they use.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.4 Lamplist Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through the lamplists.  The flipper buttons cycle through the
different ways that the lamplist can be controlled.  The default is
to turn on all of the lamps.  You can also strobe them, flash them, etc.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.5 Ball Device Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through each of the ball devices, telling you its current status
(how many balls it sees, kickouts pending, errors).  The flipper buttons
will scroll through a set of actions (empty, kick 1, etc.); press ENTER
to perform the action displayed.

   <p>This test also continuously shows the global device status, such as
how many total balls are detected and whether any balls are missing.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.6 Random Test</h4>

<p>Tests the random number generator.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.7 Transition Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through all of the dot-matrix or alphanumeric transition effects.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.8 Frame Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through all of the display frames.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.9 Force Error Test</h4>

<p>Entering this test forces a fatal error, which should restart the system.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.10 Display Stress Test</h4>

<p>Starts randomly starting and stopping display effects until exiting the test.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.11 Symbol Test</h4>

<p>Cycles through the symbol bitmap, a collection of arrows, boxes, etc.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.12 Score Test</h4>

<p>Advance through the various combinations of players per game and
player-up, to show how the score screen would look.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.13 PIC Test</h4>

<p>Displays vital data about the PIC.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.14 Memory Editor</h4>

<p>Lets you interactively scroll through the CPU's memory and alter values.
