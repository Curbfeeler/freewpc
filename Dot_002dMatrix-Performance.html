<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Dot-Matrix Performance</h2>

<p>On older machines without a dot matrix, driving
segmented score displays was a relatively low horsepower task.  Up until
the late 1980's, 7-segment displays were used that could only display numbers
(and a few letters).  Including a comma, there are only 8 bits per segment. 
Assuming 4 players per game and 8-digit scoring, that's still only 256 bits &ndash;
or 32 bytes of data &ndash; that has to be managed by the CPU.

   <p>Later, 16-bit segments were used that could display full text, which doubles
the data size, but still the quantity of data to be manipulated was low.

   <p>The dot matrix display changed that.  The DMD is 128 pixels wide by 32 pixels
high, for a total of 4096 pixels, or 512 bytes, per frame.  Let's look at some
of the challenges that are created.

<h3 class="section">E.1 Frame Rate</h3>

<p>Achieving a realistic looking animation means redrawing the display
frequently enough so that movements appear smooth.  See this article
about flicker fusion threshold for more information.

   <p>A 20Hz frame rate is decent looking.  That requires updating the display 20
times per second, or once every 50ms.  For better quality, 25Hz or 30Hz
is desirable.  However, the 2MHz processor, saturated with other things
besides DMD updating, is not well-suited to a high frame rate.

   <p>We'll assume a 20Hz frame rate throughout this article, and see how
difficult even that is to achieve.  We'll find that in some
cases, we have to settle for even less than that.

   <p>Another way of looking at it is that every 50ms, or every 97600 CPU cycles,
we need to draw and commit another display frame.  Later, we'll talk about
the CPU instruction set and how efficiently it can do some common operations.

<h3 class="section">E.2 Simulating Color</h3>

<p>The display itself has no notion of color.  Each pixel is either off, or glows
orange.  WPC games simulated different shades of orange by using a page flipping
technique.  By rapidly switching between two pages, up to 4 different colors
(3 oranges plus black) are perceived.

   <p>The key is that the two pages are not shown equally.  One of them is displayed 1/3 of the time;
the other 2/3 of the time.  If a pixel is off in both pages, it appears black. 
If a pixel is on in both pages, it appears to be on all the time, at 100%
intensity.  If a pixel is on in one page but not the other, then it appears
either 1/3 or 2/3 of the time, producing either a dark brown or medium orange
color.

   <p>The controller itself does not implement the page flipping; the software does. 
The controller can interrupt the CPU (on the FIRQ line) whenever the display
has just been refreshed.  Software can reprogram the controller to display a
different page of data at this time.  Doing it at any other time will produce
tearing, where parts of two different pages are temporarily displayed at once.

   <p>The display refreshes at 122MHz (ref); therefore, the FIRQ occurs about once
every 8ms (or 16000 CPU cycles).  The FIRQ handler needs to be fast since it
is so frequent.  All it needs to do though, is to set the active page register
in the controller to a new value.  (FreeWPC does this in less than 40 cycles.)

   <p>The same technique, with more pages, could be used to simulate more colors. 
For example, 3 pages could produce 8 colors, and 4 pages could produce 16
colors.  However, note that as more pages are flipped, the effective refresh
rate drops.  This means that the page flipping begins to be perceived as movement
and not as color change.  Showing more colors requires other techniques that
are not discussed further.

   <p>2 pages = effective frame every 3 redraws = 40Hz frame rate
3 pages = effective frame every 7 redraws = 17Hz frame rate
4 pages = effective frame every 15 redraws = 8Hz frame rate

<h3 class="section">E.3 6809 Instruction Set</h3>

<p>The 6809 does not provide much support for bulk movement of data, which is
what is mainly needed to update the display.  Assume for now that a single
512-byte, monochrome frame of data is in the game EPROM, which needs to be
copied into display memory, i.e.

   <p>	memcpy (display_memory, image_src, 512);

   <p>How long does this simplest of operations take?  It all depends on the implementation
of the copy.  Let's look at some approaches.

   <p>A simple way is to copy byte-by-byte.  Assume that the source and destination
addresses are already in registers, then we can do something like this:

<pre class="example">     loop:
     	ldb	,x+
     	stb	,u+
     	dec	count
     	bne	loop
</pre>
   <p>We use the X and U registers, because instructions using Y are one byte longer,
and also take one cycle longer.

   <p>This actually doesn't work, because count is a byte variable, and we need to
copy 512 bytes.  Also, it is inefficient because many cycles are spent in the
'dec' and 'bne'.  Loop unrolling can help us eliminate overhead:

<pre class="example">     	lda	#64
     	sta	count
     loop:
     	ldb	,x+
     	stb	,u+
     	ldb	,x+
     	stb	,u+
     	ldb	,x+
     	stb	,u+
     	ldb	,x+
     	stb	,u+
     	dec	count
     	bne	loop
</pre>
   <p>As each iteration now copies 4 bytes at a time, we can do this in 64 loop iterations.

   <p>Obviously, we could unroll some more and it would run even faster, but with
diminishing returns and at the expense of a larger program.  Code space is not
the primary concern here, but it does play a role.

   <p>The above example can be improved further by realizing that the 6809 can operate
on 16-bit words.  Loading/storing a word at a time helps a lot.  The number of
iterations can be cut in half, too, which reduces loop overhead more.

<pre class="example">     	lda	#32
     	sta	count
     loop:
     	ldd	,x++
     	std	,u++
     	ldd	,x++
     	std	,u++
     	ldd	,x++
     	std	,u++
     	ldd	,x++
     	std	,u++
     	dec	count
     	bne	loop
</pre>
   <p>The 'ldd' and 'std' instructions, in the indexed modes used above, take 7 cycles
each.  dec takes 5 cycles &ndash; or 4 if we ensure that it is in the direct page. 
(footnote here)  bne only takes 2 cycles.  So one iteration of this loop, which
copies 8 bytes, takes 63 cycles.  Multiply by 32 and we get 2016 cycles, or
a little more than 1ms, just to do a straightforward page copy.

   <p>Now consider the following:

     <dl>
<dt>&bull;<dd>Keeping all images uncompressed is not practical on the WPC platform, because
of the ROM space limitation.  In the earliest dot matrix games, 256KB ROMs were
used.  With no room for anything but graphics, these could only hold 512 pages
of data.  If 4-color images are desired, then cut that number in half.

     <br><dt>&bull;<dd>Compression is necessary, and takes CPU power to decode.  So the 1ms copy is
mostly unrealistic.

     <br><dt>&bull;<dd>In many cases, copying a single page of graphics is not what is needed. 
We may need to composite several layers of images together, including text. 
It may take 4 or 5 page-level operations (meaning, where an entire page is modified)
to compose the final image.  Some of these operations are a little more costly
than a single copy, too.

     <br><dt>&bull;<dd>Remember that we wanted a display frame every 50ms.  As we add all of this
extra complexity, this is starting to take a significant percentage of the
total CPU available. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">E.4 The Fastest Copy in Town</h3>

<p>It turns out that our copying loop is NOT the most efficient that it can be. 
Remember, the goal is to do bulk copying of data.  There actually are
instructions that can copy more than 16-bits of data at a time: the stack
push/pull instructions!

   <p>The PSHS (push) instruction can copy the contents of the A, B, X, Y, U, S,
PC, DP, and CC registers onto the stack.  Likewise PULS does the opposite,
loading from memory into registers.  These instructions don't quite work
though, because we need a working stack.  However, there is another
variant: PSHU and PULU.  These were intended to be used for a "user stack",
but for our purposes, U is just another pointer register.  If we point U
at our display page, we can do bulk copies using PSHU, and get more
than 16-bits done at a time.  [Note that this only works for either
the source or the destination, but not both.]

   <p>These instructions are not without some cost, though.  What they improve
is the overhead of instruction fetching.  Each of them takes 5 cycles plus
1 cycle for each byte transferred.  Recall that ldd/std took 7 cycles.  So
if we use the stack instructions for only 16-bits at a time, the cost is the
same.  But any additional bytes copied come for only 1 cycle per byte.

   <p>We want to push as many values in registers as possible, but we can't
use them all.  U is already being used as our pointer, so we can't use it
for the display data, too.  PC is obviously not a good candidate.  DP and
CC affect other things, so we don't want to trash them.  That leaves
A, B, X, Y, and S.

   <p>FreeWPC chooses not to use S as a data register, although it could if the
copy code was protected against interrupts and no stack variables were
needed during the copy.  In some applications, this might be possible. 
Because of the large amount of time that a copy takes, I felt that keeping
interrupts disabled for a long time was a bad idea.  So I only use A, B,
and X, and Y: 6 bytes copied at a time. [ Note: I'm not using Y. ]

   <p>And that, as far as I can tell, is THE fastest way to copy bytes on the 6809.

<h3 class="section">E.5 Bit Alignment</h3>

<p>For full 128x32 frames, a bytewise or wordwise copy doesn't need to concern itself
with the individual bits in the image.  However, when copying smaller bitmaps
to an arbitrary DMD location &ndash; for example, when drawing font glyphs &ndash;
bit aligment becomes a problem.

   <p>First, some background.  A single byte of data in the controller's memory
addresses 8 consecutive pixels within a single row.  The least-significant
bit of the data corresponds to the leftmost pixel.  That is, the value 0x01
draws one pixel aligned to the left; 0x80 is aligned to the right.  If you're
used to picturing a byte of data in its binary form, this is completely backwards from
that, which can cause some confusion when working with these algorithms.

   <p>Now say we have an 8x1 bitmap (8 pixels wide, 1 pixel high) stored in one of these bytes,
and we want to
place it anywhere on the display.  If the leftmost pixel location is byte-aligned,
this is easy; we just write the byte to that location.

   <p>If the leftmost pixel location is not byte-aligned, you can see that this will
take at least two instructions, because two different bytes of the display data
are modified.  Suppose we want to put this bitmap at a row where x=4 (four pixels
in from the left edge of the display).  How would we do it?

   <p>First, we're going to have to modify two different bytes of data.

   <p>Second, note that to be correct, we cannot just overwrite these areas, because
that would trash some of the bits that we are not concerned with.  The pixels
from x=0 to x=3 and from x=12 to x=15 should not be altered.  This requires
reading those locations, modifying only the appropriate pixels, then writing
back the results.

   <p>So already this is not trivial.  This is an important problem to solve
because this is how all fonts get drawn.

   <p>The 6809 does not support shifting more than 1 bit in a single instruction.

   <p>All this said, there are a number of efficient solutions to the problem, but
they all take a lot of CPU cycles.  FreeWPC's approach is to examine the size of
the source bitmap and the target bit alignment, to determine the most
efficient method to use.  Three different situations are handled:

   <p>1. the source width plus the bit alignment are less than 8 bits.  This means
no more than 1 byte per row need to be emitted.  This is very efficient for
small fonts in some cases. [ This is not right. ]

   <p>2. the source width is 8 bits or less, and the width plus alignment is less
than 16 bits.  This is almost as good; we can read 1 byte per row and write
2 bytes per row.

   <p>3. Everything else.  The generic method always works, but is inefficient for
all but the largest of bitmaps.

<h3 class="section">E.6 Compression Techniques</h3>

<p>FreeWPC has not experimented much with various compression algorithms for
full-screen images.  Compression has not been implemented at all for font
data and other small bitmaps, simply because the space savings would not be
worth all of the extra computation.

   <p>The goal is not perfect compression, but rather to be good enough.  The
best compressor takes time &ndash; and thereby requires time to decompress.  We
need a fast decompression algorithm that the 6809 can do well.  That limits
the scope to the simplest of algorithms.  Really good compressors work at
the bit-level, but because of the 6809's inability to do bit-level manipulation
fast, FreeWPC has only considered techniques that work a byte or a word at a time.

   <p>There are a number of basic approaches to compression.  The first is to use
a form of run length encoding (RLE), where a long string of consecutive
byte or word values is compressed into a value+count pair.  Not all images will have
long strings like this, but many do, especially runs of 0x00 and 0xFF.

   <p>The second is to use a form of delta encoding, where an image is encoded as the
set of differences from a previous image.  This is useful when doing animations,
in which consecutive images don't differ too much.

   <p>More complicated techniques than these are likely to be a burden for the 6809.
